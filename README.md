# NM---Dynamic-Imgae-Slider-
This project is a two-page responsive web application that demonstrates the integration of user authentication and a modern interactive image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.




Page 1 – Login/Signup:
Users can either register with a username, email, and password or log in with existing credentials. Authentication is managed using the browser’s Local Storage, which stores and validates user information. Error handling prevents duplicate accounts and ensures proper validation. On successful authentication, the user is redirected to the gallery page.




Page 2 – Image Slider Gallery:
The gallery page showcases a dynamic image slider that allows users to explore images in multiple ways:

Manual Navigation: Forward and backward buttons.

Dot Indicators & Thumbnails: Quick jump to any image.

Auto-Play Mode: Slideshow functionality with play/pause toggle.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Arrow keys for navigation and spacebar to toggle auto-play.




Key Features:

Smooth CSS transitions and modern UI design with gradient backgrounds.

Fully responsive layout, optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

Lightweight implementation without external frameworks (pure JavaScript).

User-friendly and interactive design suitable for portfolios, galleries, or presentations.

This project effectively demonstrates frontend development skills, combining form handling, data persistence, user experience design, and interactive multimedia presentation into a cohesive application.
